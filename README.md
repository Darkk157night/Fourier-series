# Visual representation of fourier series

The fourier series the mathematical concept of representing a complex periodic functions as a sum sines, It was developed by joseph Fourier in 18th century while trying to find a solution for the heat wave equation.

This code allows us to visualize the fourier using epicycles by using the p5.js library to draw the function.

The code has 3 built in function for square, sawtooth and triangular wave. In future more wave forms might be added.
